## Examples of how to use various  `lvgl-rs` widgets/components

All examples can be executed using:
```shell
cargo run --example <name>
```
while in the `lvgl-rs` directory (i.e. one up from this).

The `DEP_LV_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is necessary, as explained in the [README](../README.md).
